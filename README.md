# Problem Set Solutions
A problem set with applications of a predator and prey model, designing an SIR model, and a dice simulation and analysis (CLT). 

Please open the PDF for the solutions. This problem set was part of my CS166 (Modeling and Analysis of Complex Systems) class at Minerva Unviersity in junior year of college. 

# Topics and Concepts
- Modeling: Design a model - I designed a model for the ebola outbreak in Liberia in 2014
- Creating a simulation: I coded a predator and prey model using Python. It is an implementation of cellular automata. 
- Data Visualization: I cretaed visualizations of the predator and pray model amongst other graphs that served the empriircal and theoretical analysis. 
- Empirical and Theoretical Analysis of the simulation: parameters, edge cases, graphs, confidence intervals, mean, comparing the population dynamics and the behavior of the system under different parameter values.
- Theoretical Analysis: Analyzed the mdoel using Lotka-Volterra equations which are first-order, non-linear, differential equations. 
- Simulating Dice Rolls: distributions, percentiles, randomness, CLT.
